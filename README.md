weather chatbot using dialogflow
Hello and welcome to my virtual weather chatbot!


Here's the link to the project: https://bot.dialogflow.com/62d72084-46ee-49e9-9997-f1d81df33531

You have to run node index.js locally on port 3000 and run the ngrok server in order to acess the chat.

The bot has only 2 intents; the greeting and the city you want to know the weather for.
You can start by saying any greeting message like "Hi" or "Hello" then type any city you want to know its weather.

I couldnt find a covid-19 API that would serve the task.

Many thanks in advance.
